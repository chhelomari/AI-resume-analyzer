this project is an AI Resume Analyzer

This is a small project I made to analyze resumes. You can upload a PDF or DOCX file, and it will:
Check for important keywords
Give an ATS score (how good your resume is for job systems)
Suggest things to add or improve
I built it with Python and Streamlit so you can see it in your browser easily.

##How to run:
Install dependencies:
*pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app:
*streamlit run app.py

Open the link in your browser and upload a resume to test it.

Future ideas:
Compare resume to a job description/
Support multiple languages/
Add more advanced AI suggestions
